1. BaseNumber class and it's subclasses: a lot of test code duplicated. Think of some solutions
2. BaseNumber implementations are very similar to one another (they only differ in "value" type)
- is there better solution (less code duplication)?
3. Similar situation with BaseRange and its implementations. Both tests and code in subclasses
contain a lot of duplicated statements - we should look for better solution
